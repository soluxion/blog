The warm aroma rose with the evening breeze and sweet waft of roasted maize tingled Jeje’s senses. On the grill before him lay several maize of different degree of roasting ruddiness; below, pieces of smoldering coals glowed. The evening breeze stirred other things, too—some distance away the grime mass of black ashes from the market’s dusty road puffed up, circling and spiraling upwards. Jeje shuddered to think that a man’s burnt body was the ashes that just rose.

 It was just three days ago it happened. The man was scurrying along the market road; he was small and bent, clutching in his hand a sack—an innocently bulged sack that belied its grisly bloody content—the head of a girl that still wore a neatly plaited hair. Jeje knew about this incident, so did everyone else. When the man’s evil was discovered, the mob—shocked that the head might have been their neighbor’s daughter or their nieces—took to ad hoc justice and the idea of the police, or the law was forgotten for a while, as the man’s body was set flaming, reduced to ashes teased by the breeze.
 
 Jeje’s maize was ready. Carefully placing the plastic bag he held on the ground, he dug into his pocket for money. He must be careful with those stuffs (the content of the bag), he thought. The responsibility for the skull he had collected for the Christmas break where he intended it at home was upon him. It was good to be some notches above his mate; better to strut impressing his mate with his erudition at the anatomy table; and best to be popular with Mr. John, the gray-haired lab store keeper, to allow him to occasionally smuggle some bones out of the lab for home study.
 
 Small popping and bursting sounds came from the roasting maize, releasing fresh aroma. Jeje leaned forward, gave the woman the money and picked up his maize. At the same time he heard a whizzing sound of an okada, and a jangling and rumbling that was of a lorry, now, the noise winding closer, louder—
            
Jeje saw in a split-second the okada swerving closely to his side, clearing away from the lorry, and the cycle’s kickstand hooking and snatching up the bag he had laid down, dragging it along the untarred rough road. The sack bounced and galloped on the bumpy road, calling up dust, tearing, and edges and angles of the bone sticking out.

Jeje followed, trot-running.

Suddenly, the okada bumped the sack against a stone.

Neat skull flew scattering about!

The motorcycle halted. Jeje stopped. The market people lined along the road gasped. The skull, spinning for a while, stopped in front of a second-hand clothe-ware displayed beside the road.

Jeje stood, embarrassment mingled with fear swallowed him up. He threw quick glances at people’s faces. There was this unstable silence, a hush, and this dark look…rushing down, he swiftly began to collect the pieces.

“Skull!” a woman cried; it was taken up by the shriek of an old woman. 
            
Crowd had gathered in an animated circle. Jeje was crouching, bones at his feet—a scene of caught-in-the-evil-act position. How was he going to explain, explain to angry mob of illiterates? He rose and in an explanatory gesture, he falteringly said: “No...this is not human--no--I mean…," he could not finish. The man holding the bell he used in chanting his second hand clothes dashed forward saying “What! This no be human skull. This no be human skull, eh?”; and with a swing struck Jeje at the ribs with the sharp metal rim. The pain in Jeje’s rib was sharply intense, a sensation that rippled deep down the marrow of his rib. He staggered down, cringed at his side, his heart was thumping: “I’m not a ritualist. I’m a medical student--a student doctor. My sch-school w-work bones--wait--wait--”
          
His voice was drowned all up. Agents of the devil everywhere in our society, someone said. It must stop! Another cried. If it takes that our street be buried up with ashes of evil men. It must stop! 
          
The mob descended on Jeje. His hand flew randomly, blocking blows and kicks (and curses). His nose felt flat, crunched, and fresh blood streamed two parts down his swollen heavy numb lips. A stick smashed right on his left eye. Stars crackled.  Occasional blotches of phosphorescent lines appearing and disappearing in his brain. The weight of the tire thrown over his shoulders dragged him to the ground. Jeje was weak. He heard a breathing hush and an approaching siren before blackness flooded him, in which he swarm, gulped and drowned.
