When I was an innocent 16 years old boy, I discovered that I had figured out life and how I want to live it. So I sketched a butterfly, like the one above, to summarize it. 

There is the cross of equal arms that joins with the antenna: I must seek and speak the Truth always. The antenna represents Freedom. I will live life free from dogmatic reasoning. And then the creative motif on the wings: sui generis; that is, I'll choose vocational paths that allows a unique expression of myself.

Truth, freedom, self-uniqueness-these childhood ideals- growing up I observe loses it meaning with respect to the world. Do the Young-me wants the Adult-me to say the truth always, everywhere, really? The issue here is that there is no Truth, but your own subjective Truth. And the society can only promise and deliver civilization when a few subjective truth is choosen and promoted as the Truth. The price for a membership into the society is the lose of ones individuality. Some individuals manage to benefit from the society without pay the price(at least the full price). I admire them.

I am a poet, physicist and an entrepreneur.
